    The Ojibwe Teachings

     There are many different versions of this story because of the diversity of tribes there are.<br>
     We will be focusing on the Ojibwe version<br>
     <br>
     There were 7 grandfathers spirits who were given the responsibility to watch over the people of the earth by the creator. When they saw that life was not good for the people of the earth, they decided it was time to fix it. The residence of Turle Island were living in a negative and unhealthy way. To remedy it, they will give 7 teachings to a child who was not tainted by evil yet. When the child was taught them, he didn't know what it meant. It wasn't until he lived his whole life did he understand them because, every 7 years, a spirit animal would teach the child the meaning of them. <br>

    Editors Opinion

    The 7 grandfather teachings are very fascinating. What really stood out to me was how peaceful they are. They’re all the traits that fit the good samaritan stereotype. These types of teaching fit the criteria of Master Oogway. It’s interesting because while these are present in other cultures, it’s not as peaceful as this Ojibway story. In this, they teach how these are something that needs time, patience, and resilience to master as long as you’re at peace. Other cultures direct more to aggressiveness if you know what I mean. They say that if you don’t obtain these in a short amount of time, you will suffer to the ends of the earth and live the rest of your immortal being in despair and constant pain.<br>
	I really connected with the wisdom teaching. Wisdom is something that’s talked about a lot. However I think that very few people actually achieve it because the definition of wisdom is distorted in ways. If you ask me, this is the truest definition of wisdom: the ability to acquire, understand and utilize the knowledge to aid everyone. Now-a-days, I hear that wisdom means to be smart, but this first teaching is the best and original to me. It’s also supported by how this definition is probably over 5000 years old. <br>
	All these teachings are very important because these teachings fit the good samaritan stereotype. It’s a stereotype that’s not bad. If everyone were to live like this, we may actually achieve world peace! The teachings seem to be specifically designed to do this in the first place. It’s about reinforcing the 7 worldviews, and those are perfect in the first place. In conclusion these teachings are something that should be taught even in kindergarten to teach them before their minds get corrupted by the modern eurocentric society. <br>
