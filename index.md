  <h2>
    The Ojibwe Teachings
  </h2>
  <body>
     There are many different versions of this story because of the diversity of tribes there are.<br>
     We will be focusing on the Ojibwe version<br>
     <br>
     There were 7 grandfathers spirits who were given the responsibility to watch over the people of the earth by the creator. When they saw that life was not good for the people of the earth, they decided it was time to fix it. The residence of Turle Island were living in a negative and unhealthy way. To remedy it, they will give 7 teachings to a child who was not tainted by evil yet. When the child was taught them, he didn't know what it meant. It wasn't until he lived his whole life did he understand them because, every 7 years, a spirit animal would teach the child the meaning of them. <br>

  Data Processors have evolved in the past decades. It's no longer just sitting at a computer typing each individual number into a spreadsheet. Nowadays, Data Processors gather data via polls, forms, and other forms of data and draw conclusions from it. These days, Data Processors make their own software to store data and portray it. Because this skill is necessary, they take computer science courses to make these softwares. They also work with all kinds of different technologies and computers and they teach businesses what kind of technologies that should be used to grow their business.<br>
